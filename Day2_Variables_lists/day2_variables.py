#PREVIOUS WAS LIST,SUBSETTING LIST 
#MANIPULATION 
# -----------------------------------------------
# ðŸ§  Behind the scenes (1)
# When you assign y = x, Python does NOT create a new list.
# Instead, both x and y point to the SAME list in memory.
#
# That means: if you change something in y, 
# it will also affect x because they share the same reference.
# -----------------------------------------------

# Create a list and store it in variable x
x = ["a", "b", "c"]

# Assign y to the same list as x (no copy is made)
y = x

# Change the second element of y to "z"
y[1] = "z"

# Print y
print(y)  # Output: ['a', 'z', 'c']

# Print x
print(x)  # Output: ['a', 'z', 'c']

# -----------------------------------------------
# ðŸ§  Behind the scenes (2)
# In this example, we create a *copy* of the list.
#
# When we write y = list(x) or y = x[:],
# Python makes a NEW list in memory with the same elements as x.
#
# That means: if we change y, x will NOT be affected anymore,
# because they now point to two separate lists.
# -----------------------------------------------

# Create a list
x = ["a", "b", "c"]

# Make a copy of x
y = list(x)  # or y = x[:]

# Change one element in y
y[1] = "z"

# Print both lists
print("x =", x)  # ['a', 'b', 'c'] (unchanged)
print("y =", y)  # ['a', 'z', 'c'] (only y changed)


#dipendency between lists 
# -----------------------------------------------
# ðŸ§  Replacing elements inside a list
# There are two main cases:
# -----------------------------------------------

# ðŸŸ¢ 1. Simple list
# If you have a normal list with numbers or values,
# you can replace an element directly using its index.
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Replace the last element using a negative index
areas[-1] = 10.50

print(areas)
# Output: [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 10.50]

# -----------------------------------------------

# ðŸ”µ 2. List of lists
# If you have a list that contains other lists (nested list),
# you must use TWO indices:
#   - The first one selects the sublist
#   - The second one selects the element inside that sublist
house = [
    ["hallway", 11.25],
    ["kitchen", 18.0],
    ["living room", 20.0],
    ["bedroom", 10.75],
    ["bathroom", 9.50]
]

# Replace the area of the bathroom (the 2nd value in the 5th list)
house[4][1] = 10.50

print(house)
# Output: ['bathroom', 10.50] as part of the last sublist

# -----------------------------------------------
# ðŸ’¡ Summary:
# - areas[-1] = 10.50 â†’ works with a simple list
# - house[4][1] = 10.50 â†’ works with a list of lists
# -----------------------------------------------
# Create the areas list
areas = ["hallway", 11.25, "kitchen", 18.0, "living room", 20.0, "bedroom", 10.75, "bathroom", 9.50]

# Correct the bathroom area
areas[-1] = 10.50
# Change "living room" to "chill zone"
areas[4]="chill zone"
